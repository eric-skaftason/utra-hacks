# TrainWreck

Winter Olympic events like the biathlon highlight a rare balance of speed, precision, and composure under pressure. 
We were inspired by how athletes seamlessly switch between endurance-based movement and high-accuracy targeting, often in harsh and unpredictable conditions. 
TrainWreck takes this idea into robotics—challenging a robot to navigate complex terrain, make strategic decisions, and execute precise actions, all within a competitive environment.
